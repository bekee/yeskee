					<p> Imagine investing your money into a risk free business with no regrets or being paranoid of
						losing your money. Now, Yeske interconnect operates a very simple platform. It is important
						to note that our commitment to be leaders in business stems from our purpose in society,
						which is to help our customers thrive by enabling them to achieve their lifetime financial
						goals, while investing their funds in ways that will create a positive future for them,
						their families, communities and the world at large.</p>
					
					<p>There are lots of benefits attached to being a member. You stand a chance of getting a
						minimum of six thousand and a maximum of 100 hundred thousand. There are laid down rules
						that are
						expected of the clients in becoming a partaker of this offer.</p>
					
					<p>Having explained all that, the amount for each stage or level is 3000, 6000, 8000, 10,000,
						20,000, 30,000, 50,000 The most interesting part is, for each phase chosen, you get double
						of
						that plan, i.e.</p>
					
					3000 = 6000<br/>
					6000 = 12,000<br/>
					8000 = 16,000<br/>
					10,000 = 20,000<br/>
					20,000 = 40,000<br/>
					30,000 = 60,000<br/>
					50,000 = 100,000<br/>
					
					<p>
						These can happen with the power of six. In other words, you need to introduce two people and
						they
						also bring two and your stage is completed. It is expected that the two active stages have
						been
						unlocked are 3000 and 6000 therefore, its either you start with 3000 or 6000 and grow until
						it gets
						to 100,000.</p>
