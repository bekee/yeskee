							<p>Imagine investing your money into a risk free business with no regrets or being paranoid of
								losing your money. Now, Yeske interconnect operates a very simple platform. It is important to
								note that our commitment to be leaders in business stems from our purpose in society, which is
								to help our customers thrive by enabling them to achieve their lifetime financial goals, while
								investing their funds in ways that will create a positive future for them, their families,
								communities and the world at large.</p>
							<p>
								There are benefits attached to being a member. You stand a chance of getting a minimum of six
								thousand and a maximum of 100 hundred thousand. There are laid down rules that are expected of
								the clients in becoming a partaker of this offer.</p>
							<p>
								There are seven phases or stages altogether. Imagine getting a whopping 33.4% on every member
								that registers under you or you introduce. Itâ€™s mandatory to note that each level you decide to
								enter, you are expected to bring two persons which will serve as your downline. Now, each of
								these stages requires a two by two matrix. That is, you are required to bring two persons which
								will serve as your downline and the two persons are to bring another two persons also and
								continuously. But note this; each person you bring puts money into your account. Once your
								downline is completed by six persons, you automatically complete that stage and either continue
								to unlock more stages or withdraw your money.
							</p>
							<p>
								Having explained all that, the amount for each stage or level is 3000, 6000, 8000, 10,000, 20,000,
								30,000, 50,000. The most interesting part is, for each phase chosen, you get double of that plan,
								i.e.</p>
							3000 = 6000<br/>
							6000 = 12,000<br/>
							8000 = 16,000<br/>
							10,000 = 20,000<br/>
							20,000 = 40,000<br/>
							30,000 = 60,000<br/>
							50,000 = 100,000.<br/>
							<p>
								These can happen with the power of six. In other words, you need to introduce two people and they
								also bring two and your stage is completed. It is expected that the two active stages have been
								unlocked are 3000 and 6000 therefore, its either you start with 3000 or 6000 and grow until it gets
								to 100,000.</p>
							<h3>Bonus per entry</h3>
							3000 = 200<br/>
							6000 = 400<br/>
							8000 = 700<br/>
							10,000 = 1,000<br/>
							20,000 = 3,000<br/>
							30,000 = 5,000<br/>
							50,000 = 8,000.<br/>
							
							<p class="text-danger"><strong>NB</strong> - You are mandated to pay on or before 72hrs after registration, unless your account will be blocked. This is to ensure the smooth running of the system</p>
