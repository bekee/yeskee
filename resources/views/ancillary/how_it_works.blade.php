					<p>Imagine investing your money into a risk free business with no regrets or being paranoid of
						losing your money. Now, Yeske interconnect operates a very simple platform. It is important to
						note that our commitment to be leaders in business stems from our purpose in society, which is
						to help our customers thrive by enabling them to achieve their lifetime financial goals, while
						investing their funds in ways that will create a positive future for them, their families,
						communities and the world at large.</p>
					<p>
						There are benefits attached to being a member. You stand a chance of getting a minimum of six
						thousand and a maximum of 100 hundred thousand. There are laid down rules that are expected of
						the clients in becoming a partaker of this offer.</p>
					<p>
						There are seven phases or stages altogether. Imagine getting a whopping 33.4% on every member
						that registers under you or you introduce. Itâ€™s mandatory to note that each level you decide to
						enter, you are expected to bring two persons which will serve as your downline. Now, each of
						these stages requires a two by two matrix. That is, you are required to bring two persons which
						will serve as your downline and the two persons are to bring another two persons also and
						continuously. But note this; each person you bring puts money into your account. Once your
						downline is completed by six persons, you automatically complete that stage and either continue
						to unlock more stages or withdraw your money.
					</p>
					<p>
					Having explained all that, the amount for each stage or level is 3000, 6000, 8000, 10,000, 20,000,
					30,000, 50,000. The most interesting part is, for each phase chosen, you get double of that plan,
						i.e.</p>
					3000 = 6000<br/>
					6000 = 12,000<br/>
					8000 = 16,000<br/>
					10,000 = 20,000<br/>
					20,000 = 40,000<br/>
					30,000 = 60,000<br/>
					50,000 = 100,000.<br/>
					<p>
					These can happen with the power of six. In other words, you need to introduce two people and they
					also bring two and your stage is completed. It is expected that the two active stages have been
					unlocked are 3000 and 6000 therefore, its either you start with 3000 or 6000 and grow until it gets
						to 100,000.</p>
					<h3>Bonus per entry</h3>
					3000 = 200<br/>
					6000 = 400<br/>
					8000 = 700<br/>
					10,000 = 1,000<br/>
					20,000 = 3,000<br/>
					30,000 = 5,000<br/>
					50,000 = 8,000.<br/>
					
					<h3>Summary of the registration process</h3>
					1. Chose the level or stage you want to apply for<br/>
					2. Pay for the level or stage<br/>

					wasting)<br/>
